  "title": "DarkSpectre browser extension campaigns exposed worldwide",
  "location": "Global",
  "category": "Browser-extension",
  "risk": "high",
  "date": "December 2025",

  "executive_summary": [
    "Cybersecurity researchers uncovered long-running malicious browser extension campaigns operated by a China-linked threat actor tracked as DarkSpectre.",
    "These campaigns used seemingly legitimate extensions to stealthily collect browsing data, harvest corporate meeting intelligence, and commit fraud, impacting millions of users across major browsers."
  ],

  "what_happened": [
    "Threat intelligence firm Koi Security attributed multiple malicious extension campaigns—ShadyPanda, GhostPoster, and DarkSpectre—to a single threat actor cluster.",
    "Over a period spanning more than seven years, extensions were published on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox stores with positive reviews and legitimate utility before executing malicious behaviors.",
    "The third campaign, known as The Zoom Stealer, uses 18 extensions to collect corporate meeting data, including URLs, passwords, IDs, participant names, and metadata."
  ],

  "who_is_affected": [
    "Users of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox browsers.",
    "Organizations relying on web browsers for business tasks such as videoconferencing, collaboration, and online meetings.",
    "Individuals that installed popular extensions with high install counts and positive trust signals."
  ],

  "attack_flow": [
    "Malicious browser extension uploaded to official web stores and installed by users.",
    "Extensions initially behave normally to earn trust and avoid review detection.",
    "After installation, hidden scripts begin data collection—search behavior, affiliate hijacks, or meeting intelligence exfiltration.",
    "Collected data is streamed out over network connections to attacker-controlled servers."
  ],

  "business_impact": [
    "Compromise of sensitive corporate intelligence such as meeting URLs, embedded passwords, and participant details.",
    "Potential unauthorized access to corporate meetings and confidential discussions.",
    "User privacy loss and risk of spear-phishing using harvested information.",
    "Financial loss from affiliate fraud and unauthorized advertising link manipulation."
  ],

  "risk_reason": "By operating through trusted browser extension ecosystems and delaying malicious behavior to bypass store reviews, DarkSpectre leverages user trust to remain undetected for years, making mitigation difficult.",

  "what_usually_goes_wrong": [
    "Users install browser extensions without scrutinizing permissions or source.",
    "Extensions request broad access unrelated to their stated purpose (e.g., video conference platforms).",
    "Lack of centralized enterprise controls over browser extensions."
  ],

  "recommended_actions": {
    "immediate": [
      "Audit installed browser extensions across organizational endpoints.",
      "Remove any unapproved or suspicious extensions."
    ],
    "short_term": [
      "Enforce policies to whitelist only vetted extensions via enterprise browser management tools.",
      "Monitor network traffic for unexpected WebSocket connections from user devices."
    ],
    "long_term": [
      "Train users on the risks of installing third-party extensions.",
      "Implement endpoint detection tools that track extension behavior.",
      "Enable enterprise-wide browser security controls."
    ]
  },

  "what_this_does_not_mean": [
    "Every browser extension is harmful—only specific extensions with malicious payloads are at risk.",
    "User browsers are automatically compromised without user action."
  ],

  "monitoring": {
    "signs": [
      "Suspicious outbound traffic from browser processes.",
      "Unexpected data exfiltration patterns (e.g., frequent WebSocket connections)."
    ],
    "alerts": [
      "Unauthorized extension installations detected by device management.",
      "Alerts for unusual corporate meeting access or credential usage."
