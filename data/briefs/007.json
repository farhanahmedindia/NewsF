  "location": "Global",
  "category": "Vulnerability",
  "risk": "high",
  "date": "December 2025",

  "executive_summary": [
    "Multiple Fortinet vulnerabilities in FortiGate, FortiOS, FortiProxy, FortiSwitchManager, and FortiWeb are being actively exploited by threat actors. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}",
    "The flaws allow bypass of authentication and administrative access, exposing firewall management interfaces and sensitive configuration data. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}"
  ],

  "what_happened": [
    "Security researchers and incident responders observed exploitation of authentication bypass vulnerabilities affecting Fortinet products. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}",
    "CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719 were added to the U.S. CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog due to confirmed real-world attacks. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}",
    "Attackers used crafted Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) messages to authenticate as administrators, allowing unauthorized access to systems and configuration exports. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}"
  ],

  "who_is_affected": [
    "Organizations using Fortinet FortiGate firewalls and related products globally. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}",
    "Networks with exposed management interfaces accessible from the public internet. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}",
    "Teams relying on FortiCloud SSO without segregated internal management access. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}"
  ],

  "attack_flow": [
    "Threat actor targets authentication bypass vulnerability in FortiOS, FortiProxy, FortiSwitchManager, or FortiWeb. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}",
    "Crafted SAML or authentication messages bypass SSO and grant administrative access. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}",
    "Attacker exports firewall configuration and potentially extracts sensitive network information. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}",
    "Unauthorized access may lead to further network compromise or persistence."

  "business_impact": [
    "Unauthorized administrative access to firewall devices. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}",
    "Exposure of sensitive configuration files, including credentials and network topology. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}",
    "Increased risk of lateral network attacks and data exfiltration. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}"
  ],

  "risk_reason": "Vulnerabilities that allow authentication bypass or unauthorized admin access on perimeter devices like firewalls pose systemic risk, undermining network defenses at a foundational level. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}",

  "what_usually_goes_wrong": [
    "Firewall management interfaces left exposed to the internet. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}",
    "Default or weak authentication configurations. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}",
    "Slow patching and failure to apply security advisories promptly. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}"

    "immediate": [
      "Apply available security patches for all affected Fortinet products. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}",
      "Restrict management interface access to internal or secured admin networks. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}"
    ],
    "short_term": [
      "Disable FortiCloud SSO where not required or enforce strict authentication policies. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}",
      "Audit current firewall configurations for unauthorized changes. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}"
    ],

  "what_this_does_not_mean": [
    "All Fortinet deployments are fully compromised by default — risk depends on configuration and exposure. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}",
