  "title": "Fortinet firewalls exposed by active exploitation of critical vulnerabilities",
  "location": "Global",
  "category": "Vulnerability",
  "risk": "high",
  "date": "December 2025",

  "executive_summary": [
    "Multiple Fortinet vulnerabilities in FortiGate, FortiOS, FortiProxy, FortiSwitchManager, and FortiWeb are being actively exploited by threat actors.",
    "The flaws allow bypass of authentication and administrative access, exposing firewall management interfaces and sensitive configuration data."
  ],

  "what_happened": [
    "Security researchers and incident responders observed exploitation of authentication bypass vulnerabilities affecting Fortinet products.",
    "CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719 were added to the U.S. CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog due to confirmed real-world attacks.",
    "Attackers used crafted Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) messages to authenticate as administrators, allowing unauthorized access to systems and configuration exports."
  ],

  "who_is_affected": [
    "Organizations using Fortinet FortiGate firewalls and related products globally.",
    "Networks with exposed management interfaces accessible from the public internet.",
    "Teams relying on FortiCloud SSO without segregated internal management access."
  ],

  "attack_flow": [
    "Threat actor targets authentication bypass vulnerability in FortiOS, FortiProxy, FortiSwitchManager, or FortiWeb.",
    "Crafted SAML or authentication messages bypass SSO and grant administrative access.",
    "Attacker exports firewall configuration and potentially extracts sensitive network information.",
    "Unauthorized access may lead to further network compromise or persistence."
  ],

  "business_impact": [
    "Unauthorized administrative access to firewall devices.",
    "Exposure of sensitive configuration files, including credentials and network topology.",
    "Increased risk of lateral network attacks and data exfiltration."
  ],

  "risk_reason": "Vulnerabilities that allow authentication bypass or unauthorized admin access on perimeter devices like firewalls pose systemic risk, undermining network defenses at a foundational level.",

  "what_usually_goes_wrong": [
    "Firewall management interfaces left exposed to the internet.",
    "Default or weak authentication configurations.",
    "Slow patching and failure to apply security advisories promptly."
  ],

  "recommended_actions": {
    "immediate": [
      "Apply available security patches for all affected Fortinet products.",
      "Restrict management interface access to internal or secured admin networks."
    ],
    "short_term": [
      "Disable FortiCloud SSO where not required or enforce strict authentication policies.",
      "Audit current firewall configurations for unauthorized changes."
    ],
    "long_term": [
      "Implement network segmentation and zero-trust principles for management access.",
      "Integrate vulnerability scanning and automated patch management."
    ]
  },

  "what_this_does_not_mean": [
    "All Fortinet deployments are fully compromised by default — risk depends on configuration and exposure.",
    "All firewalls are breached — only unpatched, exposed devices are at immediate risk."
  ],

  "monitoring": {
    "signs": [
      "Unexpected administrative logins or configuration exports.",
      "Anomalous firewall traffic patterns."
    ],
    "alerts": [
      "Multiple failed or successful admin login attempts from unfamiliar IPs.",
      "Configuration file downloads outside scheduled maintenance windows."
    ]
