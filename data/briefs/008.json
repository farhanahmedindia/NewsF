  "risk_reason": "Delayed detection and notification of a breach involving highly sensitive personal data increases the risk of identity theft, fraud, and legal liability, making this a material risk event. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}",

  "what_usually_goes_wrong": [
    "Insufficient real-time monitoring and detection capability. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}",

  "what_this_does_not_mean": [
    "That all Cognizant services or clients were breached — this relates specifically to the TriZetto incident. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}",
    "That fraud has already occurred for every affected individual — the lawsuits address potential future risks."
