  "location": "Global",
  "category": "Botnet",
  "risk": "high",
  "date": "January 2026",

  "executive_summary": [
    "A botnet named RondoDox has been actively exploiting a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability known as React2Shell in React Server Components and Next.js.",
    "The campaign has been ongoing for around nine months, targeting IoT devices and web servers worldwide to deploy malware and cryptominers."
  ],

  "what_happened": [
    "Researchers observed the RondoDox botnet abusing the React2Shell vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182, CVSS 10.0) to gain remote code execution on exposed systems.",
    "The botnet campaign progressed through multiple phases from reconnaissance to large-scale automated exploitation.",
    "Once systems are compromised, payloads such as cryptominers, a Mirai variant, and bot loaders are deployed."
  ],

  "who_is_affected": [
    "Internet-connected web servers running vulnerable Next.js instances",
    "IoT devices exposed to the internet (e.g., consumer routers, cameras)",
    "Enterprises with unmanaged edge devices"
  ],

  "attack_flow": [
    "Botnet scans internet for systems vulnerable to React2Shell",
    "Unauthenticated exploit of RCE vulnerability on IoT and web servers",
    "Deployment of malware payloads (cryptominers, bot loaders)",
    "Persistence mechanisms installed and competing malware removed"
  ],

  "business_impact": [
    "Unauthorized remote access to infrastructure",
    "Resource hijacking (cryptomining, bandwidth consumption)",
    "Elevated risk of DDoS attacks from botnet networks",
    "Potential service degradation and increased operational costs"
  ],

  "risk_reason": "Exploitation of a critical unauthenticated remote code execution flaw in widely used frameworks makes a high number of systems vulnerable to automated compromise.",

  "what_usually_goes_wrong": [
    "Failure to patch known critical vulnerabilities in a timely manner",
    "Exposure of IoT devices without sufficient network segmentation",
    "Lack of monitoring for unauthorized activity"
  ],

  "recommended_actions": {
    "immediate": [
      "Apply patches or updates for Next.js and React Server Components to address the React2Shell vulnerability",
      "Identify and isolate vulnerable devices from public networks"
    ],
    "short_term": [
      "Deploy Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to block exploit traffic",
      "Monitor systems for unusual processes or connections"
    ],
    "long_term": [
      "Segment IoT devices into dedicated VLANs",
      "Implement continuous vulnerability scanning and patch management",
      "Adopt threat intelligence feeds to block known command-and-control IPs"
    ]
  },

  "what_this_does_not_mean": [
    "Every organization using Next.js is already breached",
    "Patching once solves all IoT security concerns"
  ],

  "monitoring": {
    "signs": [
      "Unexpected new cron jobs or persistence artifacts",
      "Unusual outbound connections from servers or devices",
      "High CPU usage indicative of cryptomining"
    ],
    "alerts": [
      "Detection of exploitation attempts targeting React2Shell",
      "Unauthorized remote shells or malware execution"
    ]
