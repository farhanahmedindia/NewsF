  "location": "Ukraine",
  "category": "Espionage",
  "risk": "high",
  "date": "January 2026",

  "executive_summary": [
    "A Russia-aligned cyber espionage group has been observed using the Viber messaging platform to distribute malicious files to Ukrainian military and government organizations.",
    "The campaign shifts malware delivery from email to instant messaging to increase success and evade traditional security controls."
  ],

  "what_happened": [
    "Attackers sent malicious ZIP archives over Viber containing Windows shortcut (LNK) files disguised as Microsoft Word and Excel documents.",
    "When opened, these shortcut files executed PowerShell commands that downloaded additional malware from attacker-controlled servers.",
    "The malware chain deployed a loader that ran in memory and ultimately installed a remote access trojan, allowing attackers to control infected systems."
  ],

  "who_is_affected": [
    "Ukrainian military units",
    "Government departments and public sector organizations",
    "Individuals receiving unsolicited files via messaging platforms"
  ],

  "attack_flow": [
    "Malicious ZIP archive sent via Viber message",
    "Victim opens disguised shortcut file",
    "PowerShell downloads additional payloads",
    "Malware executes in memory and establishes remote access"
  ],

  "business_impact": [
    "Unauthorized access to sensitive systems",
    "Potential theft of confidential or strategic information",
    "Increased risk of espionage and follow-on attacks"
  ],

  "risk_reason": "Using a trusted messaging platform as a delivery mechanism allows attackers to bypass email security controls and exploit user trust, making detection and prevention more difficult.",

  "what_usually_goes_wrong": [
    "Users trust files received through familiar messaging apps",
    "Shortcut files are mistaken for legitimate documents",
    "Messaging traffic is not monitored as closely as email"
  ],

  "recommended_actions": {
    "immediate": [
      "Warn users not to open unsolicited archives or files received via messaging apps",
      "Restrict execution of shortcut files on endpoints"
    ],
    "short_term": [
      "Monitor systems for suspicious PowerShell activity",
      "Inspect outbound traffic for unexpected downloads"
    ],
    "long_term": [
      "Include messaging platforms in security awareness training",
      "Extend endpoint monitoring to detect in-memory malware execution"
    ]
  },

  "what_this_does_not_mean": [
    "All Viber communications are malicious",
    "Messaging apps are inherently insecure"
  ],

  "monitoring": {
    "signs": [
      "Unexpected PowerShell execution",
      "Unknown scheduled tasks or startup entries"
