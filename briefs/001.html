  <h1>Email phishing attacks against Indian businesses</h1>

  <p><strong>Who this matters to:</strong>  
  Businesses in India that rely on email.</p>

  <h2>What happened</h2>
  <p>
    Attackers sent emails that looked legitimate.
    When clicked, they gained remote access to systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Why this matters</h2>
  <p>
    Email-based attacks are cheap, effective,
    and often go unnoticed until damage is done.
  </p>

  <h2>What usually fails</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No MFA on email accounts</li>
    <li>Lack of employee awareness</li>
    <li>Over-trusting email links</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable MFA for all email accounts</li>
    <li>Train staff to avoid unknown links</li>
    <li>Block risky attachments</li>
  </ul>
